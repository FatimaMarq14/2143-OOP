# Knucklebones Game Design
## Class Diagram

This class diagram will be some of the implementations I will use for my Knucklebones program. This is a draft to some ideas that were given to us in class and how they could potentially work and what they could potentially due. **Variables subject to change.**

### Dice Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `sides`: Represents the number of sides of the dice (typically 6).
  - `current_value`: Stores the current rolled value of the dice.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `roll()`: Rolls the die and assigns a random number between 1 and 6.
  - `get_value()`: Returns the current face value of the die.

- **Relationships**:
  - A `Dice` is used by a player to roll during the game.

- **Methods**:
  - `roll_dice()`: Rolls a die for the player and returns its value.
  - `place_die(column, value)`: Places a die with a specific value into the selected column on the players board.
  - `get_score()`: Returns the players current score by summing values and applying multipliers.
  - `update_score(points)`: Updates the players score with new points.
