# P03 - Knucklebones game
## Fatima Marquez
### Description:

This is my version of the Knucklebones game. Overall the sfml program will display the OOP concepts we learned in class. The game showcases key principles such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, which were covered in our coursework. The program includes the following components:

## SFML
SFML stands for Simple and Fast Multimedia Library. It is a free open source software library that provides multimedia components on a computer.

## Why should I use SFML?
- SFML allows you to create windows, graphics, and more...
  - Provides 2D graphics, Handling image and audio, and draws shapes
- It is able to use audio and netoworking
- Strong use of OOP
- Very useful for game development
- **It is Cross-platform and multi-language**
 
### Choosing SFML over NCURSES (personal opinion)
| Features | SFML            | NCURSES |
| :---:    | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Visuals |  2D graphics + Ideal for GUI    | Text Only, limited visuals |
| Multimedia | Images + Audio + etc...            | Unsupported |
| Project | Useful for complex projects            | Best for simple projects |
| Ease of Use | Clean, Strong OOP            | less Intuative |
