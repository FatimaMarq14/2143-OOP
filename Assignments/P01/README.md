## P01 - Fraction class
### Fatima Marquez
### Description:

This program implements a class called Fraction that includes overloaded operators ( + - * / ) to do between fractions. 

It uses GCD, LCD, and LCM to simplify the fractions and also shows how private and public methods are implemented. It also includes a parse function that I learned outside of class to help convert my string into fractions.
