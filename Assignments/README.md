## Assignments in 2134 OOP

This repository contains all the assignments and programs submitted during the semester for OOP. Each assignment includes its folder link, providing direct access to the corresponding files and a brief description of the work completed. I used Visual Studio Code and sometimes Replit when programming. 

|  #  | Folder Link   | Assignment Description  |
| :-: | -----------   | ----------------------- |

|  5  | [P02C](P02A)  | Ncurses Program       |
|  6  | [P03](P03/)   | Implementation of the game "Knucklebones" + SFML|


Overall I gained hands on experience and got to visually see  Object Oriented Programming concepts in class. On top of that I learned new terminal/bash commands that helped make development easier when doing the work at home. This has helped me not only simplify programming concepts that I previously struggled on, but also shortened the amount of time it took me to code and compile programs.

Thank you! :)
